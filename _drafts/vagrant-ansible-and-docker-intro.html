<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Vagrant - Ansible - Docker - Intro</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am sure you are aware of all of the buzz around <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker" target="_blank">Docker</a> containers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target="_blank">micro-services</a> right? If not, then where have you been? Also, if you are unfamiliar then hopefully you will find some use out of this series that I will be putting together over the next few weeks. What? A series of this you might be asking. Well the answer is yes. I thought it might be of some use to put together a series not only highlighting what Docker and micro-services can provide, but also add in some automation using Ansible as well as using Vagrant for our learning environment. After all, what would all of this be without some Ansible goodness added. So over the next few weeks I will publishing a series of posts, with each focusing on a specific part of the overall bigger picture of automating your Docker container deployments. This will provide some learning around each technology presented throughout the series and not just specifically around Docker.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, if you are already familiar with virtual machines (VMs). Which allows for the creation of virtualized servers on physical hardware and then apps being installed on those. Then you may be caught up a bit in regards to what Docker containers can provide. Some state that containers will replace VMs but I personally don't believe that (not at the moment). So how do Docker containers differ from VMs? Docker allows you to deploy virtualized apps onto either VMs or physical hardware removing the idea of a single app running on a server. So think of this as what VMs brought us in regards to under utilized physical servers and further slicing up compute resources. We can now run many apps (isolated) on either VMs or physical hardware.</p>
