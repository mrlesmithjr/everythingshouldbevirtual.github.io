Have you ever heard of bitrot? Well if not you should head over to
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rot "http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rot")
and have a read. I was sent this article by a colleague and I thought it
was a very interesting read. Now I have never used BTRFS but I have been
using ZFS based storage solutions for about 4 years now in my lab and of
course I absolutely love ZFS. This article does a great job outlining
the benefits of what he terms "Next-Gen" filesystems leveraging ZFS
and BTRFS. I will however take this info and go out and take a look at
BTFRS and see what it is all about.

Below is the original article that was sent to me.
