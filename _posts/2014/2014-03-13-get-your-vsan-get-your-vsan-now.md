Yes, you heard it correct. VMware Virtual SAN (VSAN) is now GA as of
03/11/2014. VMware released VMware ESXi 5.5 U1 and vCenter Server 5.5 U1
which includes the VSAN GA bits. VSAN resides in the native ESXi 5.5
kernel so no requirement of deploying any virtual appliances or anything
like that. All you need to do is acquire your license key(s), enable
VSAN and off you go. So check out the links below for more information.

Chris Wahl has published a great
[post](http://wahlnetwork.com/2014/03/12/exploring-vmware-vsan-ready-nodes-per-socket-pricing-design-guides/ "http\://wahlnetwork.com/2014/03/12/exploring-vmware-vsan-ready-nodes-per-socket-pricing-design-guides/") to get you started on the right path to using VSAN. I highly recommend checking
it out.

Duncan Epping has some great
[posts](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/category/vsan-2/ "http\://www.yellow-bricks.com/category/vsan-2/") around VSAN. (Shocking right? :) )

Rawlinson Rivera (Captain vSAN? :) ) has many great articles over at his
[site](http://www.punchingclouds.com/ "http\://www.punchingclouds.com/") as well.

For a look at VSAN pricing head over
[here](http://www.vclouds.nl/vsan-pricing/ "http\://www.vclouds.nl/vsan-pricing/").

I can tell you from my early beta testing that this is a very compelling
solution and highly robust. If you are interested in setting up a VSAN
ready nested ESXi lab you can get started with a
[powercli](https://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/build-vsan-vsphere-lab-using-powercli "http\://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/build-vsan-vsphere-lab-using-powercli") script that I created a while back.

Enjoy!
