The annual voting for the top 50 virtualization blogs for 2014 is now
open. Every year Eric Siebert takes a lot of time and puts this together
over at [vSphere-land](http://vsphere-land.com/ "http\://vsphere-land.com/"). I
have contributed to the voting over the years and now this year for the
first time my blog is part of this great list. I encourage each of you
to head over [here](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1553027/Top-VMware-virtualization-blogs-2014 "http\://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1553027/Top-VMware-virtualization-blogs-2014")
to cast your votes again this year or for your first time. Voting is
only open until 03/17/2014 so hurry up. There are some great blogs on
this list and I am honoured to be part of them this year. So if you have
found any of my contributions to be worthy please take a moment and cast
your vote. I spend a lot of time contributing here and hopefully you all
find it useful. Happy voting and thanks for visiting my blog. (BTW! I am
considered an independent blogger and new for 2013!)

Enjoy!
