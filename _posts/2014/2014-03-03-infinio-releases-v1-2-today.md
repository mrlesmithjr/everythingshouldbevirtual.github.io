This is some great news for a Monday. Infinio has released their latest
version which now fully supports vSphere 5.5. I did some extensive
[testing](https://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/infinio-nexenta-testing "Infinio Install – Nexenta Testing") on their previous release which did not fully support vSphere 5.5 but
the product was still solid. I highly recommend those who are looking
for some increased performance on your NFS datastore(s) to take a look
at them.

Below is the excerpt from their announcement.

Enjoy!
