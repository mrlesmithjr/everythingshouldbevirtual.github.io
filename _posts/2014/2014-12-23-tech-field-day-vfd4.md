Yes, you heard it right. I have been granted the honor to be a delegate
at the next Virtualization Field Day in Austin, TX January 14-16, 2015.
I am extremely thrilled and looking forward to this great opportunity as
well as being surrounded by 11 other awesome community members that will
be present

What a great group of people to be surrounded by for several days. I
always make it a must to watch each Tech Field Day live streamed when
the events take place. It is always enjoyable listening to the
presentations and having the ability to interact with the delegates
over Twitter during the event. Now I will be participating in person and
will have to watch the feeds afterwards. :) I know this is going to be a
crazy few days of non-stop overloading on the brain but it will be well
worth it.

Thanks so much to [Stephen Foskett](http://twitter.com/SFoskett "http\://twitter.com/SFoskett")
and [Tom Hollingsworth](http://twitter.com/NetworkingNerd "http\://twitter.com/NetworkingNerd")
for inviting me and also putting on these great events several times per year.
