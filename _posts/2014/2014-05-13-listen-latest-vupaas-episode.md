If you are a fan of virtualization podcasts and have not yet checked out
the [VUPaaS](http://vupaas.com/ "VUPaaS"). I highly recommend it. This
is a great podcast targeted at end users of VMware. I just so happen to
be on the
[latest](http://vupaas.com/2014/05/13/episode-11/ "http\://vupaas.com/2014/05/13/episode-11/")
episode but recommend that you check out the past episodes as well.

Enjoy!
