   title: NexentaStor 4.0.1 GA Released today
   date: 2014-04-07

NexentaStor 4.x has finally made it to GA as of today. I will be
evaluating if it makes sense to make the move yet or not prior to
upgrading my actual production lab array. Keep in mind that this is a
complete reinstall so the upgrade is disruptive. They claim the next
release will allow an upgrade from 3.x to 4.x non-disruptive. I am
curious about that one :)

In the meantime [here](http://info.nexenta.com/rs/nexenta/images/NexentaStor-4-Release-Notes.pdf "http\://info.nexenta.com/rs/nexenta/images/NexentaStor-4-Release-Notes.pdf")
is a link to the NexentaStor 4.0.1 release notes. I advise you to take a look.

Enjoy!
