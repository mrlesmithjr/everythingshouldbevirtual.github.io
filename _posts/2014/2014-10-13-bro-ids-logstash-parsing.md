  title: Bro-IDS Logstash Parsing
  date: 2014-10-13

I have spent the past several days working with Bro-IDS and Logstash
parsing and wanted to share this with anyone else who may be doing the
same and needs some decent parsing. Some pieces of this I have taken
from other sources online but have been modifying to suit my needs as
well as adding additional functionality. This will be updated as time
goes on and will be hosted on GitHub.

Enjoy!
