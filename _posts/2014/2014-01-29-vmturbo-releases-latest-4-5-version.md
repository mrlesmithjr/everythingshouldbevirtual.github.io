[VMTurbo](http://vmturbo.com/ "http\://vmturbo.com/") is a great product
in regards to overall health of your virtual environments. Their product
assists in identifying where improvements can be made as well as
providing a great level of detail of capacity and etc. One of the very
cool things is not only does [VMTurbo](http://vmturbo.com/ "http\://vmturbo.com/")
recommend improvements but will also automatically make adjustments to your
environment that you specify in your policies. This can include
distributing workloads more effectively than standard DRS delivers by
default or not only recommendations in regards to rightsizing VMs, but
actually making those changes for you if you desire full automation.
These are only a few of the feature that they brought to the table in
past releases.

With this all being said their latest version goes even beyond what they
have delivered previously. I am eagerly awaiting to dig deeper into
their latest release which was just released on 01/28/2014. I encourage
you as well to go check it out. Head over
