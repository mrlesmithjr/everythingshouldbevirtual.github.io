I wanted to throw together a video real quick to demonstrate how easy
Graylog2 can be installed using my Ubuntu auto-install script. This
video will augment the
[following](http://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/ubuntu-12-04-graylog2-installation "Ubuntu 12.04 Graylog2 Installation")
post which is a very popular post.

Enjoy!
