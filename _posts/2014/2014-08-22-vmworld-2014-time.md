The time has finally come for VMworld 2014 - US in San Francisco. I know
I am very excited this year as well I am sure everyone else (20k+) is as
well. I am looking forward to catching up with everyone as well as
meeting some of you for the first time. If you see me walking around
with an EverythingShouldbeVirtual.com or vExpert shirt stop me and say
"Hey"! I will be spending a good amount of time in the hang space
along with the other Bloggers and getting to speak with others. Some of
the events that I plan on being at include #vBeers, #VMUnderground,
Veeam Party, #vBacon, Opening Acts, #PernixPros events, #BeerTweetup
and much more. May even participate in a #vBrownbag session. :) I would
also like to get some of you together and speak Logstash if anyone is up
to it or anything else anyone would like to just talk about. So with all
of this being said "HAVE A GREAT TIME"!
