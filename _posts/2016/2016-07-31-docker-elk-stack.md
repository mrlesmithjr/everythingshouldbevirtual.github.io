In this post we will be going over setting up a quick and easy way to
standup ELK Stack using Docker containers for each of our components
required. Keep in mind that this will just cover the basics and not
going into depth on advanced GROK filtering and etc. But you can
definitely add that functionality if the desire is there. Now I have
chosen a different method of creating and maintaining my Docker
containers by using Ansible to do most of the configurations vs. using a
ton of bash. The downside is that the containers are a little larger is
size due to the overhead of Ansible being installed. I can deal with
that though for the flexibility. Also I am keeping an eye the
[ansible-container](https://www.ansible.com/ansible-container) solution
as well as it seems it is more along the lines of how I choose to
maintain my containers. I also published another
[post](https://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/docker-building-containers-using-ansible)
earlier this year around the idea of using Ansible to provision
containers but was actually leveraging some of the Ansible roles that I
had already created. I have chosen to not do this going forward (at
least for now).

I would like to touch briefly on each component providing the
**_Dockerfile_** and **_playbook.yml_**Â used. For each component I have
also included the link to the corresponding GitHub repository for
reference and more detail.

**Using docker-compose**

And finally if we wanted to spin up the whole stack using docker-compose
we can do that by creating the following **_docker-compose.yml_** file:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: mrlesmithjr/elasticsearch:latest
    volumes:
      - "./.data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data"
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
      - "9300:9300"
    restart: always

  kibana:
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch
    image: mrlesmithjr/kibana:latest
    links:
      - elasticsearch
    ports:
      - "5601:5601"
    restart: always

  logstash:
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch
    image: mrlesmithjr/logstash:latest
    links:
      - elasticsearch
    ports:
      - "5044:5044"
      - "10514:10514"
      - "10514:10514/udp"
    restart: always
```

And then spin it all up:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Now fire up your browser of choice and head over to
<http://127.0.0.1:5601>.

And there you have it, you now have a containerized ELK Stack ready for
you to get creative with your GROKing.

**Creating your own Logstash configuration**

If you would like to change the included **_logstash.conf_** with your
own you could create your own Logstash configurations and place them in
the config folder and recreate your own **_Dockerfile_** as such for
example:

`Dockerfile`:

```bash
FROM mrlesmithjr/logstash:latest

COPY config/ /etc/logstash/conf.d

EXPOSE 3515 10514 10514/udp
```

`config/logstash.conf`:

```json
input {
  tcp {
    type => "syslog"
    port => "10514"
  }
}

input {
  udp {
    type => "syslog"
    port => "10514"
  }
}

input {
  tcp {
    type => "eventlog"
    port => "3515"
    codec => "json"
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts =>; ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]
  }
}
```

Now you are ready to build your new Docker container for Logstash:

```bash
docker build -t mycustom/logstash .
```

And when that completes spin it up:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3515:3515 -p 10514:10514 -p 10514:10514/udp mycustom/logstash
```

Now enjoy your new custom Logstash configuration but don't let your
customization stop there. Head over to my GitHub repo
[here](https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/ansible-elk-processors/tree/master/templates/etc/logstash/conf.d)
to get more ideas on your parsing and etc.

Hope you have enjoyed this post and I definitely look forward to any
comments, thoughts, or opinions.

Enjoy!
