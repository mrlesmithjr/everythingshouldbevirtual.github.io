Yes you read it correctly. I am right now downloading Hyper-V 2012 to
install and start some testing. I have never considered it because of my
dedication to VMware but I am now going to give it a fair shot and see
where the use case would come in. I know there is a place for it but
where is my only thought. If there wasn't a place for it then it
wouldn't exist right? Well stay tuned for some of my discoveries and
thoughts.

Enjoy!
