  title: First issue with Nakivo Backup and Replication

Just went through the setup and built the first backup job and it ran
without issue. Was going to test a restore and ran into an issue
already. Unless I am missing something it appears that it does not
support distributed switches and will not proceed. See screenshot below
showing a blank screen for my target network.
