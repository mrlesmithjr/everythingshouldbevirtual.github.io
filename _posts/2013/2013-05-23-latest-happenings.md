I have been working on a ton of things lately without many posts. One
big reason for this is that I have been working a lot with
[Openstack](http://openstack.org "http\://openstack.org"). This has been
consuming a lot of my time lately trying to get my head around this
wonderful beast. So much to learn and where to start is the biggest
issue I have found so far. I have also began my journey to VCDX as of
Monday this week. I have put off VMware certs for a long time and have
finally decided to get busy on them. So I am currently taking the VMware
5.1 Fast Track to go ahead and take my VCP exam and then continue on my
journey. :) I know, About Time I hear! On top of all of that dealing
with some HP Flex-10 issues possibly related to firmware but to be fair
the firmware has not been updated in quite some time. I am thinking the
issue is smartlink or firmware of the Emulex cards potentially as well.
I have also been messing with the following [Hyperic](http://www.hyperic.com/ "http\://www.hyperic.com/")
(Monitoring) and [VMturbo](http://www.vmturbo.com/ "http\://www.vmturbo.com/").
So stay tuned as I will have a lot of new posts coming soon.
