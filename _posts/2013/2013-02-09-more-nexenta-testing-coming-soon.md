I have two Intel 520 120GB SSD drives on the way this week to start
doing some additional testing with ZIL/SLOG and L2ARC and using Nexenta
as my datastores for vSphere. So stay tuned.

Testing results are in and they are located [here](http://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/nexenta-performance-testing-no-ssdssd).
