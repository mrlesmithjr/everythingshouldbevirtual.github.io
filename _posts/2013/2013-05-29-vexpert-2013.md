I received the news this morning that I was added to the vExpert program
for 2013. I have to say I was really surprised and excited at the same
time that I was picked to be a part of this great group of people. This
was my first time ever applying for the program and being that my blog
has barely been around for a year now I really did not expect to receive
the great honor of this and would not be discouraged if I did not. But I
was awarded this honor and look forward to contributing in every way
that I can to the community and definitely look forward to working with
all of the other vExperts over the next year. I would also like to
extend my congratulations out to all of the other

vExperts for 2013 and keep up the great work.

Enjoy! I know I will! :)
