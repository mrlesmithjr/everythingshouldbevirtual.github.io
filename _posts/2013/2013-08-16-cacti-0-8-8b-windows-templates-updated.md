The new version of [cacti](http://www.cacti.net "http\://www.cacti.net") was
released a few weeks ago which is now 0.8.8b. I have exported the templates from
this new version and they are available on GitHub.

<https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/cacti.git>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/cacti/
```

Go
[here](http://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/cacti-templates-for-windows "http\://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/cacti-templates-for-windows")
for older versions of these templates.
