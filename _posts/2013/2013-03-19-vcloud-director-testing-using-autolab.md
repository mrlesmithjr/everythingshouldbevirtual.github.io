I will be spending a while testing out Autolab v1.1 to do some vCloud
Director testing. I checked out Autolab v1 a few months back and it was
awesome. So I figured I would give it another shot and do some deep
level testing with vCloud Director. So I will will be doing some posts
soon on my vCloud Director deep dive. If you have not checked out
Autolab I highly recommend you check it out [here](http://www.labguides.com/autolab/ "http\://www.labguides.com/autolab/").

So stay tuned! :)
