I am right now rebuilding my virtual lab to start doing some new
testing. Took some time off to get a clear head and fresh start to the
new year. So stay tuned for some new stuff. I will be doing some Veeam
Backup and Replication, vSphere Replication and SRM (Site Recovery
Manager) first off. Then I will be doing some more with Nexenta and HP
P4000 VSA's. Then some Hitachi HDS VSA testing. So lots of stuff coming
soon.
