I almost forgot to throw out props to [Sophos](http://www.sophos.com)
formerly Astaro. The new UTM 9 is the best yet. I have been using their
ASG product for a few years now. I highly recommend looking at them. A
great security appliance that covers all layers of the networking stack.
Firewall, web content filtering, web application firewall, IDS, virus
scanning, endpoint protection, application monitoring, QOS, and on and
on. Go check them out. They can easily replace all of your Cisco ASA,
Cisco IPS/IDS and etc. And the reporting built in is sick. So check them
out at their booth.
