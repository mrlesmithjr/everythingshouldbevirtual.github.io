<p>I had a great time at the VMworld 2012 Welcome Reception. Talked to several great people and companies. Many Brilliant technologies and ways of the future. I had the privilege to speak with Ashtok Patel from HP on the <a href="http://h18006.www1.hp.com/products/storageworks/io_accelerator/index.html" target="_blank">HP IO Accelerator</a> product. I am definitely going to look into this. This could definitely bring some IO nightmares to a screeching hault in the virtualization world. I also had a great conversation with <a href="http://www.catbird.com" target="_blank">catbird</a>. They have some interesting technologies that utilize vshield orchestration and allowing for flatter vlans and layer2 networking across datacenters because of PCI audit concerns around spreading a VLAN across multiple sites. This is huge for multi-tennant environments and what I was most interested in was PCI security and reporting for PCI audits. Also had some great discussions with <a href="http://www.zenoss.com" target="_blank">Zenoss</a> for monitoring. As well as with <a href="http://www.vkernel.com" target="_blank">Vkernel</a>, great things in the future and current. I plan on looking into them a lot more and comparing to VCOPS. And as far as backup technologies go I highly recommend looking into <a href="http://www.phdvirtual.com" target="_blank">PHD Virtual</a>. I plan on doing the same. Licensing per host is huge and plan to do a future comparison of <a href="http://www.veeam.com" target="_blank">Veeam</a> and PHD Virtual. If you are looking for a great storage solution I highly recommend <a href="http://www.nexentastor.org">Nexentastor</a>, an open storage platform. I have used them for the past 2 years and I cannot say enough about them. ZFS filesystem rocks for real. I also had the honor of meeting Scott Lowe crossing the intersection on my way to the event. Great guy and look forward to speaking to him again sometime.</p>
