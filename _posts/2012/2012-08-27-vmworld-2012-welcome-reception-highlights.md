I had a great time at the VMworld 2012 Welcome Reception. Talked to
several great people and companies. Many Brilliant technologies and ways
of the future. I had the privilege to speak with Ashtok Patel from HP on
the [HP IO Accelerator](http://h18006.www1.hp.com/products/storageworks/io_accelerator/index.html)
product. I am definitely going to look into this. This could definitely
bring some IO nightmares to a screeching hault in the virtualization
world. I also had a great conversation with
[catbird](http://www.catbird.com). They have some interesting
technologies that utilize vshield orchestration and allowing for flatter
vlans and layer2 networking across datacenters because of PCI audit
concerns around spreading a VLAN across multiple sites. This is huge for
multi-tennant environments and what I was most interested in was PCI
security and reporting for PCI audits. Also had some great discussions
with [Zenoss](http://www.zenoss.com) for monitoring. As well as with
[Vkernel](http://www.quest.com), great things in the future and
current. I plan on looking into them a lot more and comparing to VCOPS.
And as far as backup technologies go I highly recommend looking into
[PHD Virtual](http://www.phdvirtual.com). I plan on doing the same.
Licensing per host is huge and plan to do a future comparison of
[Veeam](http://www.veeam.com) and PHD Virtual. If you are looking for a
great storage solution I highly recommend [Nexentastor](http://www.nexentastor.org),
an open storage platform. I have used them for the past 2 years and I cannot say
enough about them. ZFS filesystem rocks for real. I also had the honor of
meeting Scott Lowe crossing the intersection on my way to the event. Great guy and
look forward to speaking to him again sometime.
