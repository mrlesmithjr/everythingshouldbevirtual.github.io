I will be going over SDRS and Storage Clusters which are new in
vSphere5. I will be going through how to set them up and how they work.
I will also be going through some of the different load balancing
algorithms to use for your VDS implementations, which will include LBT
if you have vSphere Enterprise Plus licensing.
