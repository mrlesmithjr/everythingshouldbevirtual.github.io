Good session comparing file based vs. block protocols for VMware. I use
both depending on the type of workloads that I am using. For a set it
and forget it home lab I highly recommend file based (NFS), one big
advantage of block is being able to utilize round-robin (MPIO)
multi-pathing. This is not as a big of an issue if you are using 10GB
connections to your NAS for NFS. Check it out.
