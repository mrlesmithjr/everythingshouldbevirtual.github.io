Something I have been thinking about for a few years of doing and also
using for a POC solution I would be interested in finding out if anyone
else has thought of this and/or even tested or implemented. This could
be a lot more relevant now than it was before as well. The idea is using
an HP P4000 VSA (Virtual San Appliance) to provide iSCSI datastores back
to your ESX(i) hosts using LUNS presented via fiber channel either as
traditional vmdk's or by using RDM, and set this up in multiple
datacenters to be used as a storage cluster, and the more relevant use
now would be vMSC (vSphere Metro Storage Cluster). I know this solution
will work for SRM5 already, and I am sure it would be a great solution
to use for Metro Clustering too. Especially if the solution was based on
10GB. I would love to hear from anyone on their thoughts or even better
if you have done this.
