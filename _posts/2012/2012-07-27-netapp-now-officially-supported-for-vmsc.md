Good info on NetApp being officially supported on iSCSI and NFS for
vMSC. Worth looking into. Also look into HP P4000 storage as an iSCSI
solution for vMSC as well. I believe the IBM supported solution requires
SVC to be your frontend. I use SVC now, but I like the idea of P4000
storage cluster much better at this time.
