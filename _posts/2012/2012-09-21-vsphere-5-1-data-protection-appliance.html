<p>I just installed and configured the new vSphere 5.1 VDP appliance. Very easy installation and integrates well and works very well. But of course I am now looking at the fact that I am capped at 2TB limit and I have some servers that have nearly 16TB of storage. That is a problem of course. From what I have found so far it is possible to run up to 10 VDP appliances per vCenter Server. That is great, but how can I spread the data across appliances. :) Now knowing that the builtin dedupe will help on most cases this still looks like this is the catch to possibly engage EMC to get a full blown version of <a title="http://www.emc.com/backup-and-recovery/avamar/avamar.htm" href="http://www.emc.com/backup-and-recovery/avamar/avamar.htm" target="_blank">avamar</a>. :) How nice is that. :) Maybe they will change the 2TB limit going forward? Also I do understand that this is a solution that would be useful for SMB or even a home lab. But even my home lab could outgrow that very quick. :) I am not hating here by any means. I still think this looks like a great solution which is included for us with vSphere 5.1, but it still makes <a title="http://www.veeam.com" href="http://www.veeam.com" target="_blank">Veeam</a> and <a title="http://www.phdvirtual.com/" href="http://www.phdvirtual.com/" target="_blank">PHDVirtual</a> look appealing. But hey this is our choice and this is what makes this stuff interesting. I will however still mess around with the VDP and see how well it works over time.</p>
