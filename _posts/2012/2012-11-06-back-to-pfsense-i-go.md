So after 2 years that I have been using Astaro/Sophos for my firewall I
have gone back to PFsense. Do not get me wrong, but I do really like
Astaro/Sophos. The problem I am having is running over the 50 IP limit.
Yes I know this is for home, but when doing all of the testing that I do
as well as every other device in the house it runs out quick. So I have
gone back to PFsense, which is an excellent firewall. PFsense is
extremely configurable and high performing.
