<p>Today was a little more laid back for me. I attended several sessions today. Went to NF-BCO2807 — vSphere HA and Datastore Access Outages – Current-Capabilities Deep-Dive and Tech, NF-BCO1883 — Deploying an Active/Active Datacenter with SRM 5, SPO3284 — Disaster Avoidance for Mission Critical Applications using Metro vMotion and NF-BCO2147 — VMware vCenter Site Recovery Manager – What’s New and Technical Overview. As always good information. Spent a good hour or so just walking around the exhibitors hall and talking to different companies. And stopped by to talk to the guys at CloudPhysics again, while there I had the privilege to talk to Duncan Epping and Frank Denneman, very cool dudes and obviously brilliant. Keep an eye for the guys at CloudPhysics for sure as I said last night. Also had some good conversation with IBM around PureSystems, I definitely want to look into this further, maybe our PureSystem playground will show up soon. :) I also signed up to be a VMUG member and look forward to start attending the VMUG's in Atlanta. After that I had many good conversations over at Chipotle with several different guys, and as always I am glad to be able to share my experiences over the years to those that maybe not as far along in the virtual world. Then it was onto the VMworld Party with Morning Glory and Bon Jovi, Morning Glory was very good and sounded great, Jon Bon Jovi on the other hand, I was never a Bon Jovi fan and have to say I am still not. But hey free entertainment.</p>

<p>Here are some pics of CloudPhysics with Duncan Epping and Frank Denneman. Enjoy.</p>
