I now have my HP EliteBook 8570w laptop. This laptop is going to be my
mobile lab for demo's and training. It is an Intel I7 with 32GB of Ram.
Going to be a good mobile lab. I am currently building it out with
vSphere 5.1 and will be doing all sorts of testing and scenarios. I will
also be doing some extensive testing using AutoLab and possibly
providing some feedback to the team. If there is anything you may want
to see you can comment here or email [labs@everythingshouldbevirtual.com](mailto://lab@everythingshouldbevirtual.com "mailto\://lab@everythingshouldbevirtual.com")Â for more info.
