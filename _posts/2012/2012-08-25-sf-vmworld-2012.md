I am here and ready for this week. Although feeling really under the
weather, but not going to let it keep me from this fun filled week. I am
definitely looking forward to blogging about the event this week and
being added to the VMworld bloggers site for the first time. I am
planning to put a lot out here so hopefully you will all enjoy. Stay
tuned.
