HP is announcing their biggest Storage announcements in 20 years today. The
3PAR announcement is the one that catches my eye for sure.  Now we can build
enterprise 3PAR storage as we grow instead of buying a whole rack of 3PAR
storage from the get go.  I highly recommend heading over to the link below
and checking it out for yourself.
