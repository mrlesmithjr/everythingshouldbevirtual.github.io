Recently I had the privilege to attend [NFD 24](https://techfieldday.com/event/nfd24/)
in which [DriveNets](https://drivenets.com) presented. I had never heard of them
until this event. Which I am shaming myself for because they are doing some
amazing things around transforming the network market.

One of the primary things that caught my attention was around what they are
doing by disaggregating network functions. This is something that I have experienced
in some capacity or another over the past few years. And when I understood what
they were doing, I was immediately interested.

They have two products in which I will touch on in this post. One being [DNOS](https://drivenets.com/products/dnos/) and the other is [DNOR](https://drivenets.com/products/dnor/).

## DNOS - DriveNets Network Operating System

[DNOS](https://drivenets.com/products/dnos/) is a fully featured networking
stack that runs on servers and white boxes. DNOS leverages many
cloud and virtualization technologies to make this a fully distributed OS running
as Docker containers in your network. DNOS separates the data plane on a cluster
of white boxes and the control plane on any environment supporting containers.
Therefore, disaggregating the data and control plane for massive scale.

## DNOR - DriveNets Network Orchestrator

[DNOR](https://drivenets.com/products/dnor/) is an orchestrator in which automates
the deployment, scaling and management of the DriveNets Cloud solution. Therefore
accelerating the deployment of cloud-native networks.

Because of these automated operations provided by DNOR, life-cycle management of
things such as: Zero-touch provisioning, modular software orchestration, and
scale-up and scale-down are operationalized. Providing benefits such as: shorter
maintenance windows, simplified operations, and improved reliability.

Another benefit of DNOR is complete visibility of your network. This means that
such things as: cluster views, availability, and performance within hardware and
software is visible. In turn, this assists in troubleshooting issues faster
and ensuring that network performance and availability are proactively monitored.

## Target Audience

From what I gathered at this point, it appears that service providers are the
target audience for DriveNets. With that being said, [AT&T](https://about.att.com/story/2020/open_disaggregated_core_router.html) became the first in
the industry to implement DriveNets disaggregated core routing platform. This is
obviously a huge win for DriveNets, and they definitely did a great job highlighting
this during their presentation. Huge props to the DriveNets team on this for sure.

## Conclusion

Although I have only highlighted two of DriveNets products here, I plan on digging
more into their products more in depth as time permits. As I mentioned at the
start of this post, I've been exposed to a few implementations over the past
several years where DriveNets would have been a game changer. So, I'll definitely
be keeping an eye on what they are doing over time.
