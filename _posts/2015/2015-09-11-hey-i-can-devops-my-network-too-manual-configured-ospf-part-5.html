<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hey, I can DevOPS my Network too! – Manual-configured OSPF (Part 5)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the previous <a href="http://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/hey-i-can-devops-my-network-too-auto-configured-ospf-part-4">post</a> we setup our OSPF routing topology auto-configured using Ansible. Which works really nice when we already know what our variable definitions are and the end result looks like. But maybe we do not know that yet and need to model what our topology and configurations will be. Well, this is a great learning environment to do just that. So at this point you might be thinking to yourself "We have already configured OSPF and now I want to manually configure? I must have to blow everything away and start over right?". The answer is rather quite simple thanks to our Ansible role and our variables. I will now show you how to get everything back to a starting point by only adjusting a few variables in our group_vars/quagga-routers file.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So to validate that our OSPF configuration from the previous post is still implemented let's do the following.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Assuming you still have an ssh session established with router1 (r1). If not make sure to do so now.</p>
<pre>cd /vagrant
ip route
....

</pre>
<p>As you can see from the output above all of our routing is still configured and now we want to get back to a base OSPF configuration without any routing defined in order to manually set this all up.</p>
<p>We will simply do that by modifying our <em>quagga_config_ospfd</em> variable towards the end of <em>group_vars/quagga-routers</em> file. We will change this variable from true to false. So let's do that now.</p>
<pre>nano group_vars/quagga-routers
</pre>
<p>Current:</p>
<pre>quagga_config_ospfd: true  #defines if quagga ospfd should be configured based on quagga_ospf_ vars...makes it easy to disable auto routing in order to define your routes manually
</pre>
<p>New:</p>
<pre>quagga_config_ospfd: false  #defines if quagga ospfd should be configured based on quagga_ospf_ vars...makes it easy to disable auto routing in order to define your routes manually
</pre>
<p>And to do a quick check to also validate that our OSPF configuration is in place we can view <em>/etc/quagga/ospfd.conf</em></p>
<pre>cat /etc/quagga/ospfd.conf
....
# Ansible managed: /etc/ansible/roles/mrlesmithjr.quagga/templates/etc/quagga/ospfd.conf.j2 modified on 2015-09-10 13:10:26 by root on r1

</pre>
<p>Now let's run our Ansible playbook we ran previously but this time with the above variable changed to false and see what happens.</p>
<pre>ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
</pre>
<p>After the playbook finishes you will see that our ospf configuration has changed and restarted the quagga service to reflect the changes. So what does our <em>/etc/quagga/ospfd.conf</em> look like now?</p>
<pre>cat /etc/quagga/ospfd.conf
....

<p>And to validate that our OSPF daemon is still running and ready for configuration let's telnet to the daemon again and do some checks in preparation of manually configuring OSPF.</p>

<p>As you can see from above we are in a base configuration with the OSPF daemon running and ready for our manual configurations.</p>
<p>So let's look at our diagram again and start configuring some of our OSPF topology. You will want to keep this drawing open here on out so right click and open link in new tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently connected to router1 (r1) with our ssh connection but we now need to connect to router2 (r2) as well. In order to do this we need to open another terminal window and change to our directory where our project has been pulled down from GitHub into. In my case it is <em>/Users/larrysmith/projects/vagrant-ansible-routing-template</em></p>
<pre>cd /Users/larrysmith/projects/vagrant-ansible-routing-template
</pre>
<p>Let's connect to router2 (r2).</p>
<pre>vagrant ssh r2
</pre>
<p>Validate that there are not any routes as we did on router1 (r1).</p>
<pre>ip route

192.168.250.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.250.102
</pre>
<p>Now connect to the OSPF daemon as we did on router1 (r1).</p>
<pre>telnet localhost 2604

<p>Looking at our diagram let's configure router1 (r1) as follows.</p>
<pre>conf t

<p>Now validate our running configuration to ensure our configuration from above is indeed in place.</p>
<pre>do sh run

end
</pre>
<p>Let's show our OSPF neighbors and see what that looks like.</p>
<pre>sh ip ospf neighbor
....

    Neighbor ID Pri State           Dead Time Address         Interface            RXmtL RqstL DBsmL
r1#
</pre>
<p>As you can see from above there are currently not any OSPF neighbors at this point. Why is that?</p>
<p>Let's now configure router2 (r2) as we did on router1 (r1) by doing the following on router2 (r2).</p>
<pre>conf t
router ospf
ospf router-id 192.168.250.102
log-adjacency-changes
network 192.168.250.102/24 area 1
</pre>
<p>Now validate our running configuration on router2 (r2).</p>
<pre>do sh run
....
Current configuration:

!
line vty
!
end
</pre>
<p>Now while still on router2 (r2) let's do the following.</p>
<pre>end
....
sh ip ospf neighbor
....
    Neighbor ID Pri State           Dead Time Address         Interface            RXmtL RqstL DBsmL

============ OSPF router routing table =============

============ OSPF external routing table ===========
</pre>
<p>What do you see? You should see we now have an OSPF neighbor which is router1 (r1).</p>
<p>So now let's jump over to router1 (r1) and show our OSPF neighbors there as well.</p>
<pre>sh ip ospf neighbor
....
r1# sh ip ospf neighbor

    Neighbor ID Pri State           Dead Time Address         Interface            RXmtL RqstL DBsmL

r1#
</pre>
<p>We see our OSPF neighbor is indeed router2 (r2) on router1 (r1) now as well.</p>
<p>And if we look at our routes on router1 (r1).</p>
<pre>sh ip ospf route
....
r1# sh ip ospf route
============ OSPF network routing table ============
N    192.168.250.0/24      [10] area: 0.0.0.1

============ OSPF router routing table =============

============ OSPF external routing table ===========

r1#
</pre>
<p>What did you notice on router1 (r1) and router2 (r2) when showing our routes?<br />
Let's see what is going on.<br />
But before we go further let's write our configuration and save it on both router1 (r1) and router2 (r2). In order to do that we need to do the following on both routers.</p>
<p>Router1 (r1):</p>
<pre>wr mem
....
r1# wr mem
Configuration saved to /etc/quagga/ospfd.conf
r1#
</pre>
<p>Router2 (r2):</p>
<pre>wr mem
....
r2# wr mem
Configuration saved to /etc/quagga/ospfd.conf
r2#
</pre>
<p>And now exit the OSPF daemon on each router to get us back to a command prompt.</p>
<pre>exit
</pre>
<p>Now back on our command prompt on each router (router1 (r1) and router2 (r2)). Let's look at our diagram again and run some ping tests to see what is going on.</p>
<p>Sitting on router1 (r1) let's run some ping tests to router2 (r2).</p>

<p>What happened? We cannot reach the interfaces on router2 (r2) other than 192.168.12.12 correct? Why is that?</p>
<p>Here is why...</p>
<p>We can reach 192.168.12.12 because we are directly connected to the same network from router1 (r1) with our interface 192.168.12.11 whereas 2.2.2.10 and 192.168.23.12 are on interfaces on the other side of the router not directly connected. So what went wrong here and how do we configure router2 (r2) to allow us to reach those interfaces from router1 (r1)?</p>
<p>We can fix it a few different ways actually.</p>
<p>One way is to add redistribute connected to our OSPF configuration; which if you remember from our configuration back on the Auto-configured OSPF post is what was configured (via Ansible variables - seen below), but maybe that is not what we want to do in this scenario.</p>
<p>Ansible variables (<em>/etc/ansible/roles/mrlesmithjr.quagga/defaults/main.yml</em>) which defined which redistribute modes to add.</p>
<pre>quagga_ospf_redistribute:
  - connected
#  - kernel
#  - static
#  - isis
#  - rip
</pre>
<p>But for the sake of validating and learning let's add this on router2 (r2).</p>
<p>So jump over to our ssh session to router2 (r2) and connect back into the OSPF daemon as we did above and add redistribute connected to our OSPF configuration.</p>

<p>Boom! Look there now! Our routing is working from router1 (r1) to router2 (r2) now. But again this is because why? Because we added redistribute connected to our OSPF configuration on router2 (r2).<br />
Let's look at our OSPF routes on router1 (r1)</p>

<p>We are indeed not able to reach those interfaces as you can see. So let's solve this another way instead of adding redistribute connected to our OSPF configuration on router1 (r1).</p>
<p>On router1 (r1) we will define our networks (subnets) in our OSPF configuration to solve these routing issues this time. What this method is doing for us is enabling OSPF on the interface in which these networks are connected, and in turn the neighbor will establish a connection and our routes will be added.</p>
<p>We will do that by doing the following.</p>
<p>Make sure that you have established a telnet session with the OSPF daemon on router1 (r1) and execute the following.<br />
Validate that our OSPF configuration looks like the following on router1 (r1) first.</p>
<pre>sh run
....

router ospf
 ospf router-id 192.168.250.101
 log-adjacency-changes
 network 192.168.250.101/24 area 0.0.0.1

</pre>
<p>Now let's configure our networks (subnets)</p>
<pre>conf t
router ospf
network 1.1.1.0/24 area 1
network 192.168.14.0/24 area 1

<p>So now I have shown you two different ways on how we can redistribute our routes from each router into our OSPF topology here. There are of course; many other ways to accomplish this but this should get you started.</p>
<p>Now using the diagram go on and configure the remaining routers and see what your results are. And feel free to report back on your findings so that others can learn from this as well. Including myself of course :)</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>...If you somehow get things out of sorts....simply run the Ansible playbook again to get you back into a default configuration from any one of the routers.</p>
<pre>cd /vagrant
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
</pre>
<p>Also make sure to save your router configurations as you make changes to write those configurations out to disk.</p>
<pre>wr mem
</pre>
<p>And...validate and decide if you want to save your configuration changes that were made during this post to GIT. I will let you decide :)</p>
<pre>git status
....
On branch dev
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/dev'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add ..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   group_vars/quagga-routers

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</pre>
<p>Remember what we changed in the file above? A variable? Is it important? If so, commit those changes and push them up to your GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that doing our configurations manually we may want to define our Ansible variables differently to dictate our Auto-configured OSPF method. More on this later.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Up next...Auto-configured OSPF from Manual-configured OSPF...</p>
