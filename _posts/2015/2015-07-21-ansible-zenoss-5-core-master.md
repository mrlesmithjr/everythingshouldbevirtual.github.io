  title: Ansible - Zenoss 5 Core - Master
---

As it has been some time since actually putting something together to
install [Zenoss](http://www.zenoss.org/) I figured I would set out to do
just that using [Ansible](http://ansible.com). As I began through this
it seems that the installation process is much more involved than
previous versions. First off, the majority of Zenoss 5 is container
based, i.e. [Docker](http://docker.com). So this is a good thing in
regards to upgrades and etc. However the requirements are extreme.

## Zenoss Master

[docs](http://www.zenoss.com/sites/default/files/documentation/Zenoss_Resource_Manager_Installation_Guide_r5.0.x_d1052.15.196.pdf)

-   8 CPU cores (64-bit only; real or virtual)
-   32GB RAM
-   / xfs 90GB Local disk. Includes space for internal services data and
    some backups.
-   (none) swap 15GB Local disk.
-   /var/lib/docker xfs 60GB Local disk.
-   /opt/serviced/var/volumes btrfs 1TB Remote SAN.

So just to begin this journey I wanted to share out the playbook to
deploy the Zenoss Core master server (additional playbooks coming soon).

First thing first is to deploy a server for this. This is based on
**_CentOS 7 x64_**. I was able to deploy using a **_4CPU_** and **_8GB
RAM_** vm but it is painfully slow.

Add the following hard drives to your vm when deploying. Do not
partition SDB and SDC as these will be partitioned, formatted and
mounted using the playbook.

-   SDA - / (Root) Â 36GB+
-   SDB - docker partition 50GB+
-   SDC - app partition 100GB+

Now that your server is deployed you can run the following playbook to
setup and configure your Zenoss 5 Core Master server. Feel free to make
changes where you deem necessary. One being the administrator
password... The password hashed in the playbook is `P@55w0rd`

{% endraw %}
If all goes well you should be able to connect to
**_<https://IPorHostname>_** and login with administrator and whatever
password you have defined in the playbook. Once logged in you can follow
the setup wizard to finalize the setup of your new Zenoss 5 Core Master
node.

That's all for now but I will be publishing the additional roles soon
to complete out the install of Zenoss Core.

Enjoy!
