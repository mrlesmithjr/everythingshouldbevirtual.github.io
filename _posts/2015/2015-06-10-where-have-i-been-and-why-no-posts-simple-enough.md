  title: Where have I been? And why no posts? Simple enough!

Well I have been fairly quiet and not putting out much content lately
and wanted to explain.
One easy word shall explain it!

**ANSIBLE**

Now with that said I would like to let you know that I have some fairly
decent Ansible playbooks that I have been publishing to github and have
a ton more coming. I am also working on releasing a highly available and
scalable ELK Stack Ansible playbook that will soon be on github as well.
This playbook is based on some of the
[scripts](http://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/highly-available-elk-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana-setup) that I released some time ago (1 year ago to be exact) but pretty much on
steroids. So stay tuned on that.

So for now keep enjoying and get ready! :)

You can check out my Ansible roles and such on
[github](https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/Ansible).

Enjoy
