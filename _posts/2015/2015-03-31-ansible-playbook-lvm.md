  title: Ansible Playbook - LVM
---

In spending the past few weeks learning a ton about Ansible (after
creating 30+ playbooks and roles - Some very complex :) Â more goodness
coming soon ).. One thing I wanted to do with Ansible was to configure
LVM on my Linux hosts. After some digging around and testing I came up
with this playbook and figured I would share it with others in case they
had a need for it as well. So here it is.. Will also be updating and
adding a bit more functionality around it as well. All you need to do is
tweak some of the variables to fit your requirements.

```yaml

- hosts: db-vms                                             # set to specific inventory host group or set to all for every host in inventory for play
  vars:
    config_lvm: false                                       # must be set to true in order to execute any tasks in play (failsafe option :)- )
    create: false                                           # set to true if creating a new logical volume (do not set extend or resize to true)
    resize: false                                           # set to true if resizing the logical volume (do not set create to true)
    extend: false                                           # set to true if extending the logical volume (do not set create to true)
