  title: Tech Field Day - NFD10
---

I was invited as a delegate to attend Tech Field Day - Network Field Day
10 (NFD10) in Silicon Valley the week of August 18th. This was my first
time being a delegate at a Network Field Day and it was definitely a
good time. Great presentations and delegates made for a good week. I
will be posting in the next few weeks my takes on this event but for now
I wanted to share out the link to all presentations that were given this
week. I highly recommend taking some time to watch these if you have not
already. And again, stay tuned in the next few weeks for my perspective
on the event.
