After many years of ideas, exploration, and community through **Everything Should Be Virtual**, itâ€™s time for the next chapter.

We're proud to announce that our work continues at **Methodical Cloud** â€” a new content-driven platform dedicated to clarity in automation, workflow design, and building scalable systems.

While the name has changed, the mission remains: bringing clarity and purpose to complex infrastructure and automation challenges.
