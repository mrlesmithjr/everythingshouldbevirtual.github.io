## CFD6 VMware API Questions

While, attending [Cloud Field Day 6](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd6/) in
Silicon Valley as a delegate for Tech Field Day, Dell and VMware gave us their
pitch on [VMware Cloud Foundation](https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-foundation.html).

To be clear, I had zero understanding of `VCF` prior to this. When I attend
these events I want to ask legitimately **DUMB** questions as I would as a
customer hearing about a product for the first time. Now to be fair, I
absolutely love some things that VMware does, but as most other companies out
there, there are some things that do not make sense. One of the things that I
find extremely annoying from VMware is their API functionality in most cases.
And generally the annoying part for me is the documentation around API usage.

**IT IS GETTING BETTER**

With this all being said, I'd like to walk through what was in my head while
hearing these presentations. In the previous session to the one below, we heard
all about VXRail, etc. Very cool stuff for sure. However, as the session for
`VCF` was progressing, my head went to a place of absolute disorganization based
on what I was hearing. Typical for me in most cases because to be fair, I do
not generally look at solutions in the same manner that a normal consumer would.
So, as I was listening to the `VCF` presentation, I thought that they had done
something really cool here and brought a layer of abstraction up in the stack
that a consumer could tap into from an automation perspective. Meaning that one
could simply automate a **FULL** VMware stack from a single API endpoint and not
have to worry about all of the additional layers (APIs) of everything else in
the lower levels (vCenter, vRA, vRO, NSX, etc.). So I started with my questions
to hopefully get an answer on what the real story was. Did I ask the questions
as clear as I could have? Probably not. But as usual (IMO), the lack of a clear
strategy from VMware across all products was rampant in my brain. In one instance
the reference of if you are only concerned about vCenter, then this probably is
not for you (my interpretation). In reality, I want to be concerned about the
whole stack. Full stack automation is definitely in my favor here, but I digress.
Now did I misinterpret the story being told? Possibly and I hope that is the case.
But my real point is this, every vendor needs to absolutely convey a clear story
on their strategy so that every level of consumer understands. But to be fair,
VMware is a huge company and covers a massive amount of ground. So, this is
somewhat expected but I personally think they should do a better job on telling
their complete story without all of the added layers of complexity. If I want to
do this, go over here, if I want to do that, go over there, etc., etc.

## Conclusion

As I mentioned above. I truly hope that I completely misinterpreted the story
being told. If I did, I would absolutely love some additional dialog for clarity
on my part.

In the video segment below, [Ned Bellevance](https://twitter.com/Ned1313) tees
up my questions very well. And no, we did not plan this!

In addition to all of this, [Keith Townsend](https://twitter.com/CTOAdvisor)
just published a very good article around the [VMware's Cloud in 300-words](https://www.thectoadvisor.com/blog/2019/10/2/vmwares-cloud-in-300-words) that you
should definitely check out as well.

As always, enjoy!
