Are you a manager or leader?

Say what?

This is a subject that has been on my mind for many, many years. Some may argue
that these are one and the same. They are not. However, you cannot have one
without the other, but they should not be viewed as the same. Some information
I am about to share is purely from my perspective and likely not received well
for some. This is not my intent, as it is all about sparking conversation and
making people think.

What inspired me to write this you may ask yourself. Well, there are many
different things over the past few years that have, but most recently this
twitter post inspired me to put this into words.

Outside of your team however, the leader should not easily be recognized as your team should be empowered and on the same page.

## Background

I was raised in a military family as many of us are. Things that my father taught
me regarding this were paramount to shaping me in somewhat of a different way
than most (I believe). My father taught me to be a leader by example
(as most fathers/mothers do). However, he also taught me you do not need
to be in the spotlight to be a true leader. Treat all people equally and never
put yourself above others. I remember a story he once told me where he was
promoted to a foreman (General Motors). He initially thought it would be great
but soon discovered it was not because of his peers trying to embed into him that
he was now one of them and he should not treat his former peers as the same as
he did previously. After about a week of this, he spoke up and said that
he refused to do that and wanted to no longer be the foreman and would rather
be with his people. My father was a leader to the utmost degree his entire life
until when he passed away almost five years ago. In my eyes, he is still a
leader. Another thing he taught me was to respect titles, but to take them with
a grain of salt. Titles should never dictate a conversation or persuade you in
your decision(s). This has stuck with me throughout my life.

## My Career

Now, throughout my career I have been approached many times over the past ten
years or so about taking on a management role. Anyone who knows me where this
has been discussed, you already know what my answer was.

"No way in hell, not for me."

So, in most cases it was agreed that I would function in a mentor/advisory role.
I have spent many, many years mentoring others around me to be empowered and have
a voice. I have equally worked in this capacity not only with my immediate
team(s) but also with my management team(s). I am notorious for having chat sessions with others while in meetings, guiding them in what they might want to say or do
based on the context of the meeting. Obviously I had somewhat of an answer to
give if I was providing others with the guidance. So, why would I not be the one to speak up and give the answer and be the leader? The answer is simple, let those
around you be empowered to make their voices be heard. This builds confidence
in others and empowers them. It also means that I am learning from others as well because they may interpret something different in their delivery of the message.
I feel successful by seeing others feel and be successful.

So, you might be thinking to yourself that this could be interpreted as the role
of a manager. This is where I disagree and now I will digress (maybe).

## Manager Roles

What does a manager role mean to me?

Work with me here and please do not take offense, as none is intended.

A manager should be the go to person and the face of the team in which they
represent. They do not need to be technical, and honestly I'd prefer them not to
be. They need to have their team's back in their time of need and be the one whom
is put into the spotlight. I view a manager as the dictator (not in the bad
sense). They are the one who dictates what is being asked to be done and ultimately
should be accountable for things getting done or not. In most cases they may or
may not know what needs to be done in order to deliver. They should also be
open to the fact that their team may disagree with them and let the team decide
the right course of action. Something I learned many, many years ago is that
your job is to make the manager look good! This translates to the fact that
the guidance given to your manager should be in the best interest of everyone.

Remember the part where I mentioned that titles should not dictate your
conversations or decisions? Yeah, this is where it is important. It is not a
means to disrespect your manager but to put them on the same level playing
ground. A good manager will respect this and be willing to allow this. But they
have to understand that it is about having the best interest and making them
look good! Remember the part about feeling successful by seeing others being
successful? Yeah, this is part of that.

## Leader Roles

What does a leader role mean to me?

A leader in my opinion is someone who leads by example and does not feel the need
to standout from their peers. A leader is not the goto person on the direction
of how things are moving or the face to to their team. They are however, the one
to inspire and empower others to do great things. A leader may only be recognized
by their immediate peers but outside of them they should only be viewed as part
of the team. Remember the twitter post I linked to above? My point is that the
leader is not someone who should stand out externally to their team. A true
leader will bring those up around them and the whole team should deliver the same
message. Now, their manager may recognize who the leader is but outside of that
no one should know. A true leader should never be felt they belong in the spotlight.
A true leader should have their whole team in the spotlight. Often times a true
leader may or may not even recognize that they are. If you do recognize it, be
humble about it and never use it as a way to take the upper hand. Use it in a
way to empower those around you.

## Conclusion

As you can probably tell, this is a very passionate topic for me. Am I right in
my opionions here? Probably not, as they are just that, my opinions. However, I
do believe these are great topics for discussion.

I also put this tweet out a week or so ago. And I truly meant it! And I also
received numerous amazing messages from folks! And for anyone reading this post,
feel free to reach out!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m at that point that my day to day work I do is no longer enjoyable without being more of a mentor. Problem is I need more willing mentees available.
