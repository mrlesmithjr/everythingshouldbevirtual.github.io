Oh, the joy of Ubuntu 18.04 continually amazes me. As long as I have been using
it, I have not provisioned mass VMs using a template. I use Packer for all of
my image building of course, but I only do development using Vagrant for the
most part. So, this has not been an issue so far. The issue I experienced has
been well documented, but I wanted to put this here for my own reference. Upon
spinning up multiple VMs, and then attempting to provision them with Ansible, I
started getting errors back from Ansible about issues with the SSH keys. Upon
further investigation, I found that all Ubuntu 18.04 VMs all had the same IP
address assigned from DHCP. WTF! After searching around, I found that the culprit
was coming from the same id being assinged in [`/etc/machine-id`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man5/machine-id.5.html). So, the solution is actually quite simple, and can be
resolved as part of the image building process. Simply execute the following
during your provisioning:

```bash
# Fix machine-id issue with duplicate IP addresses being assigned
if [ -f /etc/machine-id ]; then
    sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/machine-id
fi
```

Once you have done that, you are good to go!

Enjoy!
