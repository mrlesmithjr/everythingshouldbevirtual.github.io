You may or may not have heard of [StackStorm](https://stackstorm.com/) previously.
If you have not I highly recommend checking them out. StackStorm is classified as
**Event-Driven Automation**. And I feel they sum it up really well with their
quote from their website:

> StackStorm is a powerful open-source automation platform that wires together
> all of your apps, services and workflows. Itâ€™s extendable, flexible, and
> built with love for DevOps and ChatOps

Now I have dabbled with StackStorm off and on over the past 2 years but never
dedicated a great amount of time into it. Mainly because from what I had identified
from the product I always felt it was a strong player into true Event-Driven
Automation (as they preach). Now the problem for me was that **MOST** environments
are simply not ready for this. Hell, they barely even leverage true **AUTOMATION**.
But I digress here and we can discuss all of this another time. But back to my
original thoughts in regards to StackStorm being a strong player, what I mean is
that I saw enough in the product to know that I liked where they were going and
knew that there would be a time and a place when to implement the product. And
anyone who knows me very well has no doubt heard me on numerous occassions saying
**"StackStorm would be a perfect solution to do just that!"**. And generally
you would hear crickets because as I mentioned, "They are not ready", nor had
they ever heard of StackStorm. So this got me thinking that it might be an
interesting excercise to put together a series (unknown length) on StackStorm.
Beginning with setting up an isolated environment (Vagrant) for testing and
continuing on through various scenarios and such. This will be a good excercise
for myself to actually learn along with putting the series together. So with
that being said, look forward to upcoming posts as the series plays out and
hopefully it will be of some benefit to others.

Enjoy!
