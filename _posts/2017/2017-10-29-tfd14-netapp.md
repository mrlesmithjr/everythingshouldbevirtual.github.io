  title: TFD14 - NetApp
---

NetApp was a presenter at [TFD14](http://techfieldday.com/event/tfd14/)
which took place in Boston. They showcased their dedication to the Open
Source world along with their DevOps related initiatives. Yes, you heard
it right. They are not just a storage company. [Andrew
Sullivan](https://twitter.com/andrew_ntap) did a great job presenting
and walking everyone through their dedication to
[thePub](http://netapp.io). [thePub](http://netapp.io) is NetApp's
portal (so to say) to many of their Open Source projects and
communications.

What I found to be interesting is that they did not spend a lot of time
talking about traditional NetApp storage ideologies. But rather focused
on how they embrace the, wait for it, DevOps community. Yes, you heard
it. They have actually been a big contributor to the OpenStack project
for several years, so NetApp's involvement with Open Source is not
something new. NetApp also maintains a fairly active
[GitHub](https://github.com/netapp/) account.

They did touch on their [NetApp Docker Volume
Plugin](https://github.com/NetApp/netappdvp) storage driver for
containers as well. Now I have not had an opportunity to actually test
this out but would be interested in doing so here at some point.
