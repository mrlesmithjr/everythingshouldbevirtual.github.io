I previously posted this post [New Journey Begins](https://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/announcements/new-journey-begins/)
which was about my new journey at [Verizon Telematics](https://www.verizontelematics.com/).
Well I am here today (even though this new journey began a little over 2 months
ago, I am just now catching up on posting) to announce that I have joined [BTA](https://www.biztecharchitects.com/) as a Senior DevOps Engineer. I am back
working with some amazing people that I have worked with previously, either as
co-workers or as a client of BTA. I am/have been super excited to be part of this
new family of mine. So many things on the horizon with so many opportunities. In
this new journey you can expect that I will be posting much much more and more
involved in community contributions and etc. This is also my first time being on
the provider side of the house. So I am definitely excited for this newness and
getting to work with many others to help them on their journey into [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code).

I highly recommend following the following folks on Twitter with whom I am
working with at BTA.
