Welcome to the new [EverythingShouldBeVirtual](http://everythingshouldbevirtual.com)
site. I had been planning on moving from a hosted Wordpress site for a few years
now but I was stuck in a contract. I am now in the transition phase so hopefully
this will work out great. Please bear with me as I continue to cleanup previous
posts. If you find anything unusual please let me know. What to expect going
forward? Many more posts. I have been lacking on content over the past year or
more for many reasons which I will not get into. However, rest assured you will
be getting much more content and hopefully very beneficial information. What I
have learned by going through this transition is how our content changes over time.
I have definitely changed in my content for sure and hopefully it will only get
better with time.

Enjoy!
