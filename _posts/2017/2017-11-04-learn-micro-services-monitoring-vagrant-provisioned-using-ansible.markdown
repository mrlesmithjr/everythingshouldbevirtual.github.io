As I continue to work through some previous little projects I have worked on over
the past year or so I came across this one which I think is very useful, especially
for those who may be trying to get a grasp on Micro-Services and specifically
with monitoring. I had created this as a lab using Vagrant for others to consume
and learn from. This post will not go into all of the details as the README in
the GitHub repo does a pretty good job of that. So I will just add the link to
the repo here.

Enjoy!
