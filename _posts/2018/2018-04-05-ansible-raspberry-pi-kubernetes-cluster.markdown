Recently I started working on a little project which involved building a
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using Raspberry Pi's. I published
this project on GitHub under [ansible-rpi-k8s-cluster](https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/ansible-rpi-k8s-cluster)
for anyone who may be interested in this. Basically the foundation of this project
was to build a small cluster to do some testing and etc. This post is not to go
into the details of that project because the GitHub repo contains all of the down
and dirty details. Obviously I wanted this solution to be automated therefore
I could ensure that it was repeatable and predictable. I have been now using this
solution for a few months and have not had any issues thus far. However, I am
anticipating some issues when I attempt to upgrade to the latest version of Kubernetes.
And of course I will be publishing a post when going through the upgrade here
very soon.

And most of all, if you have not checked out the GitHub repo above around this
project, I highly recommend checking it out. And I would love some feedback.

Enjoy!
