# #NFD17 - It's A Wrap

I had the great pleasure to once again be a delegate at [Tech Field Day](http://techfieldday.com/)
this past week in Silicon Valley, CA. This event was [NFD17](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd17/)
and had some great presentations once again by the following vendors:

-   [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/)
-   [Cumulus](https://cumulusnetworks.com/)
-   [Extreme Networks](https://www.extremenetworks.com/)
-   [Ixia](https://www.ixiacom.com/)
-   [Juniper](https://www.juniper.net)
-   [Mellanox](http://www.mellanox.com/)
-   [ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/)
-   [VMware](https://www.vmware.com)

There was obviously a similar story from many of the vendors. Mainly around
automation and intent based networking. So over the next few weeks I will be
publishing some posts on a few of the presentations which I found to be the most
interesting and probably a few which I found not so interesting. So stay tuned.
